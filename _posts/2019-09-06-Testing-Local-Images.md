The company responsible for organizing the gala want to place street teams at entrances to subway stations. The street teams collect email addresses and those who sign up are sent free tickets to the gala. They want to increase the participation of women in technology.

As we are a Data scientist team, we conducted an EDA on MTA data set to get insights on the data for clientâ€™s purpose.

We will help them to optimize the placement of their street teams by determining the busiest stations and times.
