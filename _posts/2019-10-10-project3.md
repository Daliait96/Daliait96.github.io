Bank Marketing Classification

### Introduction:

Nowadays, marketing spending in the banking industry is massive, meaning that it is essential for banks to optimize marketing strategies and improve effectiveness. Understanding customers’ need leads to more effective marketing plans, smarter product designs, and greater customer satisfaction. <br>


The main objective here is to predict whether a project of a bank's telemarketing campaign would success or not based on the response of the customers.<br>


### Project Plan

* Data acquisition.
* Exploratory Data Analysis.
* Modeling
* Data visualization.
* Results Analysis.


### Data acquisition

The dataset is "Bank Marketing Analytics" taken from kaggle platform.<br>

Dataset link: https://www.kaggle.com/yufengsui/portuguese-bank-marketing-data- set<br>

The Dataset is contains 45209 records and the 16 columns, the columns are: <br>

* Age
* Job
* Marital
* Education
* Default
* Balance
* Housing
* Loan
* Day
* Month
* Duration
* Campaign
* Pdays Previous
* Poutcome Response

### EDA

To obtain a better understanding of the dataset, the distribution of key variables and the relationships among them were plotted.

As shown in the graph above, in the target column contains imbalance Data , it will be handled by oversampling (SMOTE).<br><br>

The distribution of age: In its telemarketing campaigns, clients called by the bank have an extensive age range, from 18 to 95 years old.<br><br>

The distribution of balance: The range of balance is from a minimum of -6847 to a maximum of 10443.<br>

### Modeling

Using classification models where can categorize data into a given number of classes.<br>
The main goal of a classification problem is to identify the category/class to which a new data will fall under.

#### Baseline

* Model : KNN using CV = 10.
* Score = 0.87

#### Confusion Matrix

#### Models that used in the classification analysis process

Before doing the oversampling <br>


* Model Name : GaussianNB , Score = 0.83
* Model Name : Decision Tree , Score = 0.87
* Model Name : Random Forest , Score = 0.89
* Model Name : Logistic Regression , Score = 0.89

#### The Imbalanced Data

The imbalanced data solved by oversampling it using SMOTE. <br>

#### Models that used in the classification analysis process

After doing the oversampling <br>


* Model Name : GaussianNB , Score = 0.76
* Model Name : Decision Tree , Score = 0.86
* Model Name : Random Forest , Score = 0.78
* Model Name : Logistic Regression , Score = 0.84

#### Choosing the best Model

By using the pipeline to select the best values for the parameters to see the best model.

* The best model is : Random Forest Classifier.
* Score = 0.899

### Results Analysis

 The most responsive customers possess these features:<br>

* age < 30 or age > 60
* Student and Retired people
