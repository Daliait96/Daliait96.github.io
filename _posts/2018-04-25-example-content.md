## My Graduation Project

Dawa'ee : Medication Adherence Intelligent System
Sep 2017 – May 2018

Project descriptionDawa'ee is a Medication Adherence Intelligent System. It is my graduation project supervised by the Head of Information Technology Department: Nora AlTwairesh.


Dawa'ee is an iOS mobile app can schedule the medicines automatically according to expert rules that are fed into the system along with a database of possible medications also, can schedule the medicines any time if the patient wants to take it in a specific time or in a specific period. The patient can scan the name of the medicine and save it, to avoid writing a wrong medicine name. Also, it is common that the patient could be visiting more than one healthcare provider at different hospitals or clinics; this raises another issue, which is the possibility of getting prescriptions for the same medication. This could happen because most medications have different commercial names while they are the same scientific name. Usually, patients are not sophisticated enough to notice this. That is why Dawa’ee also includes a medication duplication checker.
